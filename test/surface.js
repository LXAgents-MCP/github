/*
 * The tool surface this server is meant to serve, pinned in one place.
 *
 * Adding, renaming or removing a tool is a change to a public surface and a release, so the
 * list is written out and not derived: the registry, protocol and stdio tests all compare
 * against it, and a tool that appears or vanishes without an edit here fails all three.
 *
 * Each tool is tagged with the kind of change it makes, and the registry test holds its
 * annotations to that kind:
 *
 *   read     only reads
 *   write    creates something; repeating the call repeats the effect
 *   update   changes something that exists; repeating it changes nothing more
 *   destroy  deletes, overwrites or merges
