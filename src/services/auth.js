/**
 * The two secrets this server deals with, and which one is for what.
 *
 * - **`MCP_AUTH_TOKEN` guards the door.** It is the server's own secret for the HTTP transport: a
 *   client proves it holds it with `Authorization: Bearer <token>`, and a server install - one that
 *   listens where other machines can reach it - refuses to serve HTTP without one. A local install
 *   listens on loopback only and may leave it unset; the `Host` and `Origin` checks in
 *   `src/routes/http.js` then stand where the token would. stdio is a pipe the client spawns on its
 *   own machine, so there is nobody to authenticate and `src/index.js` never reads it on that path.
 * - **`GITHUB_API_KEY` is the key to GitHub.** It is the token every GitHub call is made with, on
 *   both transports, read from this process's environment when a tool is called. A client never
 *   supplies it and never sees it, and the bearer a client presents is never sent to GitHub.
 *
 * Nothing here writes to stdout: on stdio, stdout is the protocol channel.
