 * Server entry point.
 *
 * Gives an LLM access to GitHub over MCP, over stdio by default and over HTTP when
 * MCP_TRANSPORT=http. The token is the GitHub token and is never an argument:
 *
 * - stdio: the client starts this process and speaks to it over a pipe; register it with the
 *   token in its `env` block.
 *
 *   {"mcpServers": {"lxagents-github": {
 *     "command": "node", "args": ["<this file>"],
 *     "env": {"MCP_AUTH_TOKEN": "<token>"}}}}
 *
 * - HTTP: every request carries the token as `Authorization: Bearer <token>` (src/http.js).
 *
 * The token this server uses can change and delete repositories. A pipe can only be reached by
 * the client that spawned it; the HTTP transport can be reached by anyone who can open its port,
 * so it binds loopback unless HOST says otherwise and refuses any request without a token. The
 * only other network traffic is outbound, to api.github.com, and only when a tool is called.
 *
 * Nothing here may write to stdout: on stdio, stdout is the JSON-RPC channel.

const USAGE = `LXAgents GitHub MCP Server

Usage: node src/index.js [options]

Serves GitHub tools over stdio, or over HTTP when MCP_TRANSPORT=http. The GitHub token is
never an argument:
  stdio  set MCP_AUTH_TOKEN in the environment of this process; it is read when a tool is called.
  http   send Authorization: Bearer <token> with every request; MCP_AUTH_TOKEN is not read.
         PORT (default 3001) and HOST (default 127.0.0.1) say where it listens.

Options:
  -h, --help       Show this help
  -v, --version    Show the version
