/*
 * Server entry point.
 *
 * Gives an LLM access to GitHub over MCP, over stdio by default and over HTTP when
 * MCP_TRANSPORT=http. Two secrets, neither an argument:
 *
 * - GITHUB_API_KEY is the GitHub token, used for every call on both transports.
 * - MCP_AUTH_TOKEN is this server's own access token, which an HTTP client must present as
 *   `Authorization: Bearer <token>` (src/routes/http.js). stdio never reads it.
 *
 * stdio: the client starts this process and speaks to it over a pipe; register it with the GitHub
 * token in its `env` block.
 *
 *   {"mcpServers": {"lxagents-github": {
 *     "command": "node", "args": ["<this file>"],
 *     "env": {"GITHUB_API_KEY": "<token>"}}}}
 *
 * The key this server uses can change and delete repositories. A pipe can only be reached by the
 * client that spawned it; the HTTP transport can be reached by anyone who can open its port, so it
 * listens on port 3000 on all interfaces unless PORT and HOST say otherwise, refuses to start without an
 * access token, and refuses any request that does not carry it. The only other network traffic is outbound, to
 * api.github.com, and only when a tool is called.
 *
 * Nothing here may write to stdout: on stdio, stdout is the JSON-RPC channel.

const USAGE = `LXAgents GitHub MCP Server

Usage: node src/index.js [options]

Serves GitHub tools over stdio, or over HTTP when MCP_TRANSPORT=http. Neither secret is
an argument:
  GITHUB_API_KEY  the GitHub token; set it in the environment of this process, read when a tool
                  is called. Used on both transports.
  MCP_AUTH_TOKEN  http only: the server's access token, at least 32 characters, which every
                  request must carry as Authorization: Bearer <token>. HTTP will not start
                  without it. stdio does not read it.
  PORT (default 3000) and HOST (default 0.0.0.0, every interface) say where HTTP listens.

Options:
  -h, --help       Show this help
  -v, --version    Show the version
