/**
 * Where the GitHub token comes from, and the rules for the one that arrives over HTTP.
 *
 * Over stdio the client spawns this process, so there is no request to carry a credential and the
 * token is read from the environment, from `MCP_AUTH_TOKEN`. Over HTTP every request carries its
 * own, as `Authorization: Bearer <token>`, and that token is the GitHub token: it is used for the
 * GitHub calls of that request and kept nowhere. The server holds no secret of its own.
 *
 * **The two sources never mix.** A process that serves HTTP never reads `MCP_AUTH_TOKEN`: a
 * request without a token is refused, it does not fall back to the owner's. `enterHttpMode` makes
 * that a property of the process, so it does not depend on the request context having survived to
 * the point a tool asks for the token.
 *
 * Nothing here writes to stdout: on stdio, stdout is the protocol channel.
