/**
 * The HTTP transport: `POST /mcp`, and `GET /healthz`.
 *
 * Two kinds of install, told apart by where the server listens:
 *
 * - **A server install** listens where other machines can reach it (`0.0.0.0`, or any `HOST` that
 *   is not loopback). Every route but `GET /healthz` needs `Authorization: Bearer <token>`, and the
 *   token is this server's own access token, `MCP_AUTH_TOKEN` (`src/services/auth.js`). It is a
 *   secret between the client and this server: it is checked before anything else is read - before
 *   the body is parsed and before a path is matched, so a caller without it cannot make this server
 *   read 4 MB or find out which routes exist - and it is never sent to GitHub. The server refuses to
 *   start without an access token, rather than serving an open door.
 * - **A local install** listens on loopback only, and may leave `MCP_AUTH_TOKEN` unset: nothing beyond
 *   this machine can reach it. With no `HOST` and no token it is what the server does. A web page
 *   open on this machine still can, through DNS rebinding, so without a token a request must say it
 *   is addressed to loopback in `Host`, and in `Origin` when it sends one, before anything is read.
 *   A token that is set is required here as well.
 *
 * The calls to GitHub are made with `GITHUB_API_KEY` from this process's environment, whoever the caller is.
 * Nothing is stored between requests: each one gets its own `McpServer`, closed when its response
 * is.
 *
 * This file is the entry point `npm run start:http` runs, and `src/index.js` reaches it when
 * `MCP_TRANSPORT=http`. It listens on port 3000, on all interfaces when an access token is set, as
 * `shared-instruction` does, and on 127.0.0.1 when none is, unless `PORT` and `HOST` say otherwise. It
 * holds a GitHub key, so what guards a server install is the access token it refuses to start without;
 * whatever exposes it beyond a trusted network must terminate TLS.
 *
 * Diagnostics go to stderr, as everywhere in this server.
