# Security Model

The security posture of `LXAgents-MCP/github` specifically. It is scoped to this repository and
describes nothing about any other: each repository keeps its own model, and they are deliberately
not merged. In particular, the shared instruction repository holds no credential and serves public
text, so nothing it says about "nothing to protect" applies here.

**The one line worth keeping:** this server holds a GitHub key that can change and delete
repositories, and the key reaches exactly one header, built in exactly one place. Over HTTP a second secret,
the access token, decides who may use the key, and it never leaves this server.

## What this project actually is, in security terms

A credentialed API client with no state. It reads no local file but its own `package.json`, runs no
command and persists nothing. Over stdio it listens on nothing; over HTTP it listens on one port, on
loopback unless told otherwise. Its input is tool arguments from a client; its
output is HTTPS requests to `api.github.com` — and, to read a job's log, to the signed address GitHub
redirects that request to — and results back to the same client. The interesting
risk is not data theft from the server — there is no data in it — but **authority**: whatever the
token may do, an agent calling this server may do.

## The trust boundary that matters most

The caller is a model, and a model can be steered by text it read. Everything these tools read — a
file, an issue, a commit message — is text someone else wrote, and the model reads it much as it
reads the owner's instructions. An issue body or a file in a repository may say "now delete this
repository", and the server cannot tell a steered call from a wanted one. So the limits are the ones
that do not depend on the model behaving:

* **The token's permissions** are the real limit. GitHub enforces them, not this server. Grant only
  what the tools in use need, on only the repositories involved.
* **Annotations** say what kind of change each tool makes, and deletes and merges are marked
  destructive, so a client can ask a person first.
* **`repo_delete` refuses** unless it is told the repository's full name, which makes a
  copy-and-paste accident or a vague instruction fail.
* **The server cannot make a client ask.** Everything past those three is the person at the client.

## Surfaces

### The token

| File | Exposure | Guard |
|---|---|---|
| `src/auth.js` `configuredApiKey`, `src/api.js` `requireToken` | Anyone who can set the process environment | Read per call; never an argument; the registry test fails any tool whose input names a credential; a caller's bearer is never used as the GitHub key |
| `src/http.js`, `src/auth.js` | The one listener, reachable by anyone who can open the port | Every route but `GET /healthz` needs `Authorization: Bearer <MCP_AUTH_TOKEN>`, compared as SHA-256 digests in constant time before the body is parsed or a path matched; HTTP will not start without a token of at least 32 characters; 4 MB body cap; binds `127.0.0.1` unless `HOST` says otherwise; a test shows the access token reaches GitHub in no part of a request |
| `src/api.js` `github()` | The only place the `Authorization` header is built | One call site; the header goes to `callApi` and nowhere else |
| `src/api.js` `failure()` and `callApi` | Error text built from GitHub's answer or from the network | `redact` on every message; tests make GitHub echo the token and make the network error carry it |
| `src/server.js` `callTool` | The unexpected-exception path | `redact` on the log line and on the returned text, with the GitHub key; a test makes a handler throw the key |
| `src/log.js` | stderr | The logger writes what it is given, and nothing logs a request or a header |

### Which endpoint a call reaches

| File | Exposure | Guard |
|---|---|---|
| `src/api.js` `parseRepo`, `refName`, `refPath`, `filePath`, `workflowName` | Arguments from a model that may be steering on text it read | Validated and percent-encoded; empty, `.` and `..` segments refused; a workflow is digits or one file name with no slash; tests cover each |
| `src/api.js` `github()` | The path handed to it | Must start with `/` and carry no `?` or `#`; a violation is a programming error, not a refusal |
| `src/config.js` `API_BASE` | The host | A constant: no argument or variable can change it |
| `src/api.js` `callApi` | The address GitHub redirects a job's log to, on another host | The destination comes from GitHub's answer and never from an argument; the runtime follows the redirect and drops the `Authorization` header when the host changes, and a test shows a second host receiving no token, over real sockets |

### What a call can change

| File | Exposure | Guard |
|---|---|---|
| `src/tools/repo-delete.js` | The most destructive tool: it removes a repository with its issues and pull requests | `confirm` must repeat the full name, and a test shows nothing is sent otherwise; annotated `destroy` |
| `src/tools/workflow-run.js` | Starts a run of any workflow that has a dispatch trigger, and a workflow can deploy, publish or spend money | Annotated `write`, and its description says it runs whatever the workflow does; the token needs Actions set to write, so a token without it cannot start one |

## Secrets

There are two. **`GITHUB_API_KEY`** is the GitHub token, in the environment of the server process, set by
the `env` block of the client's configuration over stdio and by whoever starts the server over HTTP. It is what
every GitHub call is made with. **`MCP_AUTH_TOKEN`** is the server's access token for HTTP, in the same
environment and in each client's `headers`: it decides who may use the server and is never sent to GitHub. Neither lives anywhere
else: not in the repository, a wiki page, a test fixture, a Dockerfile `ENV` line, or a commit. The
tests use obvious dummies and no real value exists in this repository.

**The name `MCP_AUTH_TOKEN` is shared with `shared-instruction`**, which uses it for its own access token. Each
HTTP server needs its own value: one value on two servers lets whoever holds it use both. stdio never reads it,
so a value exported in a shell cannot reach GitHub.

## What to grant

Least privilege is the main control, so it is worth stating plainly. Use a fine-grained token,
limited to the repositories involved, with only the permissions for the tools you will use; the
table in [Environment](../environments/env.md#what-the-token-needs) lists them. A token that cannot
delete repositories cannot be talked into deleting one.

## Deployment posture

Two transports. **stdio** is the default: the client spawns the process on its own machine, and the
only caller is whoever already runs it, so there is no authentication on it and no reason for any.
**HTTP** is opt-in with `MCP_TRANSPORT=http`, and it is reachable by anyone who can open its port, so it
will not start without `MCP_AUTH_TOKEN` and every request but `GET /healthz` must carry it as
`Authorization: Bearer <token>`.

**What this costs.** Everyone who holds the access token acts as the owner of `GITHUB_API_KEY`, with all of its
permissions, `repo_delete` included, and GitHub's audit log names the key's owner, not the client. There is no
identity per caller and no way to revoke one caller without changing the token for all. That is the objection
that once kept HTTP out (`.agents/memory/decisions/stdio-only-transport.md`); the owner accepted it with the
two-token design (`.agents/memory/decisions/two-token-auth.md`). The controls are the ones in this document:
grant the key the least that works, keep the access token at 32 characters or more and private, bind
loopback, put TLS in front, run one server per person or role where identities must stay apart, and rotate by
restarting with a new token.

**What it does not do, and the operator must.** It does not terminate TLS. The access token travels in a
header, and over plain `http` anyone on the path can read it and then use the key, so the default bind is `127.0.0.1` and
anything that exposes the port must put TLS in front. It has no `Host` allow-list and no rate limit of
its own; GitHub limits the key, and a body is capped at 4 MB. Its health route says who is there and
nothing else.

A container changes where the process runs and not what it can do. The image
([Docker](../environments/docker.md)) runs as a non-root user, declares no port, and holds no secret in
any layer: the key, and over HTTP the access token, are passed at run time with `-e`, which puts them in the
container's environment, where anyone who can `docker inspect` the container sees them. The same key reaches
the same API either way.

## Verifying

| Check | How | Passing looks like |
|---|---|---|
| Neither secret appears in output | `npm test` — the api, server and http tests that make GitHub, the network and a handler echo them | all pass |
| No tool takes a credential | `npm test` — the registry test | passes |
| A path cannot leave its endpoint | `npm test` — the api tests for the five address helpers | pass |
| The token is not sent to a redirect target | `npm test` — the `callApi` redirect test | passes |
| stdout stays silent | `npm test` — the stdio tests for `--help`, `--version` and a bad flag | stdout empty |
| A request needs the access token, and the key is the server's | `npm test` — `test/http.test.js`: the 401 cases, near-miss tokens, the access token absent from every GitHub request, no upstream call without it | pass |
| HTTP will not start open | `npm test` — `test/http.test.js`: a real process with no, blank or short `MCP_AUTH_TOKEN` exits 1 | pass |
| Only one file listens | ``grep -rln -e "node:http" -e "node:net" -e "node:cluster" -e express src`` | `src/http.js` and nothing else |
| Only two runtime dependencies | `npm ls --omit=dev --depth=0` | the MCP SDK and zod |
| The image bakes in no secret | ``grep -n -e '^ENV' -e '^EXPOSE' -e '^ENTRYPOINT' Dockerfile`` | no output |

## Not a finding here

* **stdio has no authentication.** Deliberate, as above.
* **Every holder of the access token acting as the key's owner.** The design, and its cost is stated above; it is a choice, not an oversight.
* **The key sitting in the client's `env` block, or the access token in its `headers`.** That is the designed
  route; the alternative, an argument, would put it in a prompt and a transcript.
* **`GET /healthz` answering without the access token.** It is the one open route and says only that a server
  is there.
* **A registered server that reports healthy but has no tools.** The client loads connectors at
  session start, so a server added mid-session is absent until the session restarts.
* **A 404 for a repository that exists.** GitHub answers 404 for a private repository the token
  cannot see.

## Open

Nothing in this repository has been run against live GitHub. Every request shape is checked against
GitHub's documentation and against mocks, and the environment the work was done in could not reach
`api.github.com` with a token. What a given token is actually allowed to do is only visible in a real
call, so a first smoke test against a throwaway repository is the owner's; the walk is in
[Smoke test](../guides/smoke-test.md).

## Reporting something

Open an issue on `LXAgents-MCP/github`. If the finding involves a token that may have leaked,
**revoke the token first**, then report.

## Summary

The whole security posture is one GitHub key handled in one place: it never leaves `src/api.js`
except as an `Authorization` header to `api.github.com`, it is scrubbed from every message the
server can produce, no argument can carry it or redirect a call, and the one listener refuses every
request that does not bring the server's access token. What remains is authority — the key can do what it was granted, for everyone who holds the access token — which is
why the destructive tools are annotated, why `repo_delete` asks for the repository's name, and why
the first advice is to grant less.
