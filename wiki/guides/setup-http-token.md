# Set Up the HTTP Transport with a Token

How to run this server as an HTTP service and connect a client to it with a bearer token. It serves
the same 45 tools as the stdio server; only how it is reached and how it gets the GitHub token
differ.

## When to use it

| | stdio (the default) | HTTP |
|---|---|---|
| Who starts it | The client, as a subprocess | You, once, and clients connect to it |
| Where the GitHub token goes | `MCP_AUTH_TOKEN` in the server's `env` block | `Authorization: Bearer <token>` on every request |
| Who can reach it | Only the client that spawned it | Anyone who can open its port and sends a token |
| One instance for several clients | No, one process per client | Yes, and each client sends its own token |

Use stdio when a single client runs the server on its own machine; it is simpler and needs no port.
Use HTTP when several clients should share one running server, or the server runs on another host.

**The bearer token is your GitHub token.** The server has no secret of its own and stores nothing:
it uses the token on a request for the GitHub calls of that request and forgets it. Two clients with
different tokens act as two different GitHub users, with each token's own permissions.

## 1. Create a token

On GitHub, create a personal access token, preferably a fine-grained one limited to the repositories
the agent should touch. What each tool needs is in
[Environment](../environments/env.md#what-the-token-needs).

## 2. Start the server

From a checkout, once `npm install` has run:

```bash
npm run start:http
```

No token is given to the server, and it does not ask for one. It prints:

```text
lxagents-github <version> serving over http on http://127.0.0.1:3001/mcp
a bearer token (your GitHub token) is required on every route except GET /healthz.
```

That works the same on Windows, macOS and Linux. `MCP_TRANSPORT=http npm start` does the same where
the shell accepts a variable prefix; in PowerShell set it first with `$env:MCP_TRANSPORT = "http"`.

| Variable | Default | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `PORT` | `3001` | The port to listen on. The GitLab server defaults to `3002` and `shared-instruction` to `3000`, so all three can run together. |
| `HOST` | `127.0.0.1` | The interface to listen on. Loopback only, by default. |
| `MCP_TRANSPORT` | `stdio` | `http` (or `streamable-http`) selects this transport when you start `src/index.js`. |

```bash
PORT=8080 npm run start:http
```

**`MCP_AUTH_TOKEN` is not read over HTTP.** If it is set in the server's environment, the server says
so on stderr and ignores it; a request with no token is refused, never run with that one.

## 3. Check it with curl

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:3001/healthz
# {"status":"ok","server":"lxagents-github","version":"<version>"}

curl -i -X POST http://127.0.0.1:3001/mcp
# HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized
# WWW-Authenticate: Bearer realm="mcp"

curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:3001/mcp \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $GITHUB_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Accept: application/json, text/event-stream" \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"tools/list"}'
# {"result":{"tools":[ ...45 tools... ]},"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1}
```

`GET /healthz` is the one route that needs no token; it says who is there and nothing else.

## 4. Register a client

Give the client the URL and the token in a header. For Claude Code:

```bash
export GITHUB_TOKEN=<your GitHub token>
claude mcp add --transport http lxagents-github http://127.0.0.1:3001/mcp \
  --header "Authorization: Bearer $GITHUB_TOKEN"
```

Or commit a project `.mcp.json` that reads the token from the environment instead of holding it:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "lxagents-github": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "http://127.0.0.1:3001/mcp",
      "headers": { "Authorization": "Bearer ${GITHUB_TOKEN}" }
    }
  }
}
```

The client fills in `${GITHUB_TOKEN}` from its own environment. Then **restart the client**: it loads
its server list at session start, so a server added mid-session is absent until it restarts.

**Use a variable name of your own on the client side, not `MCP_AUTH_TOKEN`.** `shared-instruction`
uses `MCP_AUTH_TOKEN` for a different secret, its own access token, and a client that expands the same
name for both entries would send one of them to the wrong server. For the same reason, set
`MCP_AUTH_TOKEN` for a stdio server only in that server's own `env` block, never exported in a shell:
a stdio process inherits its environment, and a value meant for `shared-instruction` would be sent to
GitHub as if it were a GitHub token.

## 5. Putting it on a network

The default is loopback, so only this machine can reach it. To reach it from another machine:

1. Set `HOST` to an interface that machine can reach, or to `0.0.0.0`.
2. **Put TLS in front.** The token travels in the `Authorization` header of every request, and over
   plain `http` anyone on the path can read it. This server does not terminate TLS; put a reverse proxy
   or load balancer that does (nginx, Caddy, a cloud load balancer) in front, and give clients the
   `https://` URL.
3. Treat the port as reachable by anyone: a request needs a token to do anything, and a token is only
   as private as the path it travelled.

There is no allow-list for the `Host` header and no rate limit in this server. GitHub limits each token
on its own, and a request body is capped at 4 MB.

## 6. In a container

The image starts stdio by default. To serve HTTP from it, select the transport and bind the interface
the published port reaches:

```bash
docker run --rm -p 127.0.0.1:3001:3001 -e MCP_TRANSPORT=http -e HOST=0.0.0.0 "lxagents-github:$VERSION"
```

`HOST=0.0.0.0` is for inside the container, where loopback cannot be reached through a published port;
`127.0.0.1:` in `-p` keeps it reachable from this host only. No token is passed. See
[Docker](../environments/docker.md).

## If you used the old variable

`LXAGENTS_MCP_GITHUB_API_KEY` is gone. For stdio, rename it to `MCP_AUTH_TOKEN` in the `env` block of the
server's entry. Nothing else about a stdio registration changes.

## When something is wrong

| You see | Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `401` with `WWW-Authenticate: Bearer realm="mcp"` | No `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header, another scheme, or more than one credential | Send the header with the token alone |
| `401` with `error="invalid_token"` | The credential is longer than 512 characters or has a non-ASCII character | Send the token as GitHub gave it |
| A tool says GitHub rejected the token (401) and names the `Authorization: Bearer` header | GitHub does not accept it: expired, revoked or mistyped | Create a new token |
| A tool says GitHub refused (403) | The token lacks a permission | Grant it; the message says which |
| `405` | A `GET` or `DELETE` to `/mcp` | Use `POST` |
| `406` or a client error about content types | The request lacks `Accept: application/json, text/event-stream` | Send both |
| `404` | A path other than `/mcp` | Use `/mcp` |
| `413` | A body over 4 MB | Send less |
| `could not listen on 127.0.0.1:3001` | The port is taken | Set `PORT` |
| `PORT must be a whole number` | `PORT` is not a port | Fix it |
| `MCP_AUTH_TOKEN is set ... and is ignored over HTTP` | A leftover value in the server's environment | Nothing needs doing; remove it to silence the line |

## What the server does with the token

It reads the token from the header of one request, uses it for that request's calls to
`api.github.com`, and drops it. It is never written to the log or a result, and a message that would
contain it is scrubbed first. See [Security model](../security/security-model.md).
