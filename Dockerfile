# produce a smaller context, not a smaller image.

# Dependencies come from the lockfile only: `npm ci` fails rather than resolve something the
# lockfile does not contain, which is the point of building an image from a versioned tree.
# Lifecycle scripts are off, because running a dependency's install script by default is
# supply-chain risk with nothing to offset it, and `--omit=dev` keeps the test-only tree out.
# `.dockerignore` leaves the tests out too, so this image cannot run its own suite.

RUN npm ci --ignore-scripts --omit=dev

# `package.json` is read at start for the version, so it stays beside `src/`.

USER node

# No EXPOSE, on purpose: the default is stdio, which has no port, and HTTP is opt-in with
# `-e MCP_TRANSPORT=http`, published by `-p` at run time. A stdio client reaches
# it through the container's stdin and stdout, so it runs with `docker run -i`. Without `-i`
# Docker attaches no stdin, the server sees it closed, and exits at once.
#
# No secret is here either. A value baked into an ENV line ships to everyone who pulls the
# image; both are passed at run time: `-e GITHUB_API_KEY` for the GitHub key, and for HTTP also
# `-e MCP_AUTH_TOKEN`, the access token clients present.
#
# The whole default is CMD and this file sets no ENTRYPOINT, so the base image's own
# `docker-entrypoint.sh` stays in place and a command after the image name runs as written. An
# ENTRYPOINT of ours would turn `docker run <image> node src/index.js --version` into
# `node src/index.js node src/index.js --version`.
CMD ["node", "src/index.js"]
