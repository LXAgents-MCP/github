# Repository State

## 2026-10-10

**Unreleased.** `package.json` is `0.0.0`. The first release, `0.1.0`, is the last task of the
request recorded in `tasks/forge-servers.md`; until it lands this file describes a repository being
built, and the release task rewrites it.

**What it is.** A stdio MCP server, `lxagents-github`, over the GitHub REST API at `api.github.com`.
Plain JavaScript, Node ESM, no build step, two runtime dependencies: the MCP SDK and zod.

**Surface.** One tool per module in `src/tools/`, and the full list is pinned in
`test/surface.js`. `repo_create` was moved here from the `cli` server, where it was
`create_github_repo`. The others are added by the tasks that follow it in the record. A tool count
is deliberately not stated here: it goes stale at the next module.

**Token.** `LXAGENTS_MCP_GITHUB_API_KEY`, read when a tool is called. No other variable is read,
and the only flags are `--help` and `--version`.

**Verified.** The suite replaces `fetch` and never touches the network. **Nothing has been
exercised against live GitHub:** the environment the work was done in could not reach
`api.github.com` with a token, so every request shape is checked against GitHub's documentation
and against mocks only. A first smoke test is the owner's.

**Not built.** No CI. No HTTP transport (decision `stdio-only-transport.md`). No GitHub Enterprise.
Not published to npm (`private: true`). A `Dockerfile` for a stdio image exists and has never been built.
