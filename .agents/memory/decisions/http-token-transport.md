# This server serves HTTP, and the bearer token is the GitHub token

## 2026-10-10

**Decision.** `lxagents-github` speaks stdio by default and HTTP when `MCP_TRANSPORT=http`. Over HTTP
every route but `GET /healthz` needs `Authorization: Bearer <GitHub token>`, and that token is used for
the GitHub calls of that one request and kept nowhere. The one variable is `MCP_AUTH_TOKEN`: over stdio
it holds the GitHub token, and over HTTP it is never read. This replaces
[`stdio-only-transport.md`](stdio-only-transport.md); the owner reopened that decision.

**Why this answers the objections recorded there.** That record kept HTTP out because a listener would
let anyone holding the server's bearer token act as the person who owns the GitHub token, with no
identity per caller and no way to revoke one caller alone. Passing the GitHub token through removes the
server-held secret those objections were about:

| Objection | Answer |
|---|---|
| Anyone with the server's token acts as its owner | The server has no GitHub token of its own. A caller acts as whoever's token it sends, with that token's permissions, and GitHub's own audit log names it. |
| No identity per caller | The identity is the GitHub token, so there is one per caller. |
| Cannot revoke one caller | Revoking a GitHub token ends that caller and no other. |
| TLS | Not terminated here. The default bind is `127.0.0.1`; anything that exposes the port must put TLS in front, because a GitHub token sent in clear text can be read on the path. |
| Rate limiting | GitHub limits each token. The server adds a 4 MB body cap and checks the token's shape before it reads a body, which is all it can honestly add. |
| The listener is reachable without a token | Only `GET /healthz`, which answers who is there and nothing else. |

**What stays true.** An environment token is never an HTTP fallback, or a caller with no token would act
with the owner's. A process that serves HTTP says so to the code that fetches the token
(`enterHttpMode` in `src/auth.js`), so this does not depend on a request context surviving. The token is
checked for shape only, with no length floor: `shared-instruction` refuses under 32 characters, which
would refuse a valid GitLab token, and GitHub is the one that knows whether a token is valid.

**The name.** `MCP_AUTH_TOKEN` is the name `shared-instruction` uses for a different secret, by the
owner's instruction. A value exported in a shell for one would be inherited by a stdio process of the
other and sent to GitHub, so the documentation says to set it only in a server's own `env` block.

**Alternatives declined.** A separate server access token beside a GitHub token in the environment: two
secrets, and still an environment. Removing stdio: it breaks every registration and `docker run -i`.
Express: the SDK's transport runs on `node:http`, so no dependency is added.

**If it is reopened.** Per-IP rate limiting, a `Host` allow-list and TLS termination are the things not
done here, and each is its own task.
