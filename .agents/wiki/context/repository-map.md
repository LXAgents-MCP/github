# Repository Map

Read this before changing anything here. Underlying facts live in `wiki/`; this page is the
agent-facing orientation and links out rather than restating.

## What this repository is

`LXAgents-MCP/github` — an MCP server named `lxagents-github` that gives an LLM access to GitHub
through the REST API, over stdio or HTTP. Plain JavaScript, Node ESM, no build step. It is a **consumer**
of the shared instruction set and the **producer** of the tool surface in `src/tools/`; see
[`../../rules/repository.md`](../../rules/repository.md).

## What lives where

| Path | Contents | Touch it when |
|---|---|---|
| `src/index.js` | The one entry point: `--help`, `--version`, `MCP_TRANSPORT`, the stdio transport, `SIGINT` and `SIGTERM`. | The process contract. |
| `src/http.js` | The HTTP transport and the only listener: `POST /mcp`, `GET /healthz`, a fresh stateless server per request, `PORT` and `HOST`. Also what `npm run start:http` runs. | Anything about serving over HTTP. |
| `src/auth.js` | The two secrets: the access token for HTTP (`MCP_AUTH_TOKEN`: the 32-character floor, the bearer parser, the constant-time comparison) and the GitHub key (`GITHUB_API_KEY`). | Anything about either secret. |
| `src/server.js` | Builds one `McpServer`, registers every tool, shapes results, and carries the `instructions` text every client reads at `initialize`. | The protocol surface. |
| `src/api.js` | The GitHub client: the token, addressing (`parseRepo`, `refName`, `refPath`, `filePath`, `workflowName`), `callApi`, `github()`, the wording of every failure, paging. | How a call is addressed, made, or fails. |
| `src/args.js` | Argument checks: text, flags, whole numbers, choices, lists. | A new kind of argument. |
| `src/render.js` | The one renderer from a payload to the text the model reads. | How a result reads. |
| `src/schemas.js` | Shared zod fragments (`repoArg`, paging) and the four annotation sets. | A fragment or hint several tools share. |
| `src/text.js` | `short`, `firstLine`, `head`, `tail`, `cutText`, `decodeText`, `looksBinary`, `cleanLog`. | Cutting, decoding or cleaning text. |
| `src/shapes.js` | GitHub's objects as the tools report them — a repository, a release, an issue, a job — each a schema and the function that fills it, and `expectBody`, which checks an answer is the object expected. | A second tool returns an object another already does. |
| `src/contents.js`, `src/releases.js` | What several tools share: a file's path, encoding and blob sha; finding a release by its tag, drafts included. | Those two subjects. |
| `src/config.js` | Every constant: the variable name, API base and version pin, timeout, limits, the HTTP defaults. | Changing a limit. |
| `src/errors.js`, `src/log.js`, `src/version.js` | `Refused`; the stderr logger; `ROOT`, `VERSION` and `SERVER_NAME`. | Rarely. |
| `src/tools/` | `index.js`, the registry, and one module per tool. | Adding or changing a tool — **a release**. |
| `Dockerfile`, `.dockerignore` | The image (stdio by default, HTTP when told to): `node:22-alpine`, `npm ci --ignore-scripts --omit=dev`, `USER node`, `CMD ["node", "src/index.js"]`, and nothing else. It has never been built. | The image changes — and say it is unbuilt if it still is. |
| `test/` | One file per subject, plus `helpers.js` and `surface.js`, which every other file imports. | Always. Every behavioural change ships with a test. |
| `.agents/` | This repository's own rules, indexes, agent wiki and memory. | You are changing something true only here. |
| `wiki/` | Human documentation, and `wiki/logs/` for release history. | A person needs to read it. |

There is no `dist/`, no `src/transport/` and no `content/`; HTTP is `src/http.js` and nothing else. If a file you are about to
edit is under one of the first three, it does not exist here.

## Entry point

There is **one**: `src/index.js`, what an MCP client spawns. It reads `MCP_TRANSPORT`: stdio connects a
stdio transport and exits by itself when its client goes away, because stdin closes; `http` hands over to
`src/http.js`. Either handles `SIGINT` and `SIGTERM`, and nothing writes to stdout. Behind it,
`src/server.js` calls `createServer()`, which registers whatever `src/tools/index.js` discovered. (`npm run
start:http` runs `src/http.js` directly.)

## Commands

```bash
npm install
npm test
npm start                                   # stdio; GITHUB_API_KEY comes from the environment
npm run start:http                          # HTTP on :3000, all interfaces; needs MCP_AUTH_TOKEN (32+ chars) too
GITHUB_API_KEY=<token> npm run inspect      # the MCP Inspector, to drive it by hand
```

## Gotchas that actually bite

* **Nothing writes to stdout.** stdout is the JSON-RPC channel. A stray write corrupts the stream
  and the client reports a JSON parse error that points at the payload, not at the logging.
* **Starting without the GitHub key is fine; HTTP without the access token is not.** The key is read when
  a tool runs; without it the tool refuses and names `GITHUB_API_KEY`, which is not a broken server. HTTP
  with no `MCP_AUTH_TOKEN`, or under 32 characters, exits 1 on purpose.
* **A server registered mid-session is absent until the session restarts.** The client loads its
  connectors at start.
* **The tool list is pinned.** Add a tool without its line in `test/surface.js` and three tests
  fail. That is the design, not friction.
* **`mockApi` fails on any request it was not told about.** If a tool makes one more call than the
  test queued, the failure reads `unexpected request #n`, and it is correct.
* **`node --test` runs `helpers.js` and `surface.js` too.** They define no tests; the runner's total
  counts them.
* **GitHub answers 404 for a private repository the token cannot see**, so a 404 can mean
  "not visible", not "does not exist". The refusal says so.
* **A tool file's name is its tool's name.** Renaming the file is renaming the tool, which is a
  breaking change for any client that calls it.

## Generated and vendored paths

`node_modules/` only. Nothing is generated into the tree.

## Where the shared set resolves from

The connector `lxagents-shared-instruction`, never a file in this repository.
